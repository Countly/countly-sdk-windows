##What's Countly?

[Countly](http://count.ly) is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics and push notifications application. It collects data from mobile devices, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, and mobile SDK that sends this data. Both parts are open source with different licensing terms.

##About

This repository includes the Countly mobile analytics SDK for Windows Phone. This SDK is used to understand Windows Phone analytics with Countly server. Note that it currently doesn't support push notifications for Windows Phone devices, however we expect this feature to be available very soon.
