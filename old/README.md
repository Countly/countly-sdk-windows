##What's Countly?

[Countly](http://count.ly) is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics application. 
It collects data from mobile devices, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application 
usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, 
and mobile SDK that sends this data. Both parts are open source with different licensing terms.

This repository includes the SDK for Windows Phone. It's developed by [Tom Myles](mailto:tom.m935@gmail.com), [Devran EroÄŸul](mailto:devran@gmail.com)
and [Orkun Senturk](mailto:orkun.senturk@8bitiz.com).


##Installing Windows Phone SDK

  1. Download Countly Windows Phone SDK
  2. Extract all to any folder
  3. Open **Countly.sln** file with Visual Studio 2012
  4. You now have three projects in your solution : Countly (main SDK) , OpenUDID (dependency) and Countly Test quickstarter project.
  5. Right click solution , click **"Manage NuGet Packages"**. Select Online and search for **Json.NET** and install it for Countly SDK project only. After installation completed, go to References of the Countly SDK project and check **newtonsoft.json** is added to the references.
  6. Right click Countly SDK project, click Properties, then at Application tab select appropriate **"Target Windows Phone OS Version"**. If you select Windows 7, please **comment or remove line 2 in Countly.cs** in Countly SDK project :


<pre class="prettyprint">
   #define WP8
</pre>

  7. Right click Countly Test , click properties then at Application tab select **Target Windows Phone OS Version**. 

  8. Go to **App.xaml** file in Countly Test project and update init method in **Application_Activated** and **Application_Deactivated** event handlers with your application key. There is third optional parameter at init method which you can use to send your application version number to countly. Final look should be like this :

<pre class="prettyprint">
...
   // Code to execute when the application is launching (eg, from Start)
        // This code will not execute when the application is reactivated
        private void Application_Launching(object sender, LaunchingEventArgs e)
        {
            System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem((o) =>
                {
                    Countly.Countly.SharedInstance().init("http://demo.count.ly", "YOUR_APP_KEY", "2.0");
                    Countly.Countly.SharedInstance().OnStart();
                });
        }

        // Code to execute when the application is activated (brought to foreground)
        // This code will not execute when the application is first launched
        private void Application_Activated(object sender, ActivatedEventArgs e)
        {
            System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem((o) =>
            {
                Countly.Countly.SharedInstance().init("http://demo.count.ly", "YOUR_APP_KEY", "2.0");
                Countly.Countly.SharedInstance().OnStart();
            });
        }
...
</pre>


  9. Build solution and now you have ready for test your first application. Right click to Countly Test project and click **"Set as StartUp Project"**

  10. You can run your application on a device or an emulator provided by Visual Studio Windows Phone 8 development kit.
